                            The novel coronavirus has brought the world to a
                            standstill. From the huge death toll to the
                            extremely high number of infected people, this virus
                            has come for us all. And unfortunately, the effects
                            of it have spread to the economy and the workforce.
                            With everyone quarantined, shops, commercial spaces
                            shut and businesses working from home, the way we do
                            business has changed.
                          </p>

                            With your customers restricted to their homes,
                            reaching them digitally is the only way to go. But
                            here’s the kicker: every other brand and business
                            has also reached the same conclusion. That means the
                            digital space is going to be more crowded than ever,
                            and standing out and being seen is going to be a
                            much tougher battle. Staying relevant, competitive
                            and delivering value digitally is now more important
                            than having a big office, huge inventory and a great
                            sales team. Shocking as it maybe, this wake-up call
                            might be the catalyst necessary for your business’s
                            digital transformation. Adapting to a new normal is
                            an absolute necessity for any business or brand that
                            wants to stay afloat. Fortunately, there is a
                            solution: digital marketing.

                            Digital marketing, an additional tool for businesses
                            previously, is now the need of the hour. The
                            pandemic has changed not just how we live, but also
                            how we communicate, browse, purchase and
                            re-purchase. This is where the right digital
                            marketing can transform your business. With a big
                            slow down in traditional forms of marketing, there
                            is a huge surge in the time people are spending
                            online, consuming content, interacting on social
                            networks and looking for new information. This is
                            therefore where your brand needs to be, and what it
                            needs to do.

                            Here are three of the most helpful digital marketing
                            efforts you should try:
                          </p>
                          <h6>Search Engine Optimization:</h6>
                          <p style="text-align: justify">
                            Search engine optimization, or SEO as it is commonly
                            called is the process of making your website easy to
                            find and increasing its ranking so that it is
                            visible on the first page of a search engine’s
                            results. These days until your website is on the
                            first page, you lose relevancy as well as visitors.
                            With SEO, you can generate organic traffic on your
                            page and get better search results and rankings on
                            different search engines. SEO is therefore a very
                            important part of a good digital marketing strategy.
                            The process usually involves finding the right
                            keywords and strategy and targeting audience for
                            your brand, on page and off page optimisation,
                            improving UX and page responsiveness.
                          </p>

                          <p style="text-align: justify">
                            Building a strong online presence, generating user
                            traffic, increasing leads, getting more conversions,
                            and eventually getting good ROI are the benefits of
                            a good search engine optimization strategy.
                          </p>
                          <h6>PPC Marketing</h6>
                          <p style="text-align: justify">
                            PPC refers to pay-per-click marketing which is an
                            important tool in any digital marketer’s kit.
                            Through PPC marketing, you can ensure visits to your
                            website rather than waiting around for them to
                            happen organically. In this method, you pay a fee
                            only when your ad is clicked upon, thereby leading
                            to the name, pay per click. As you do not have to
                            spend for the ad to be displayed or for the
                            impressions or placement, but only for the number of
                            times it is clicked upon, this is a good method of
                            monitoring your spends. Some of the benefits of PPC
                            marketing include more traffic to your website and
                            an increase in sales figures. Through remarketing,
                            PPC can also help you increase your brand
                            recognition. As you are not dependent on SEO or the
                            Google algorithm, the changes and evolutions in them
                            do not harm your PPC marketing strategy. You also
                            have the added benefit of being able to get fast and
                            measurable results through PPC.
                          </p>

                            With a huge amount of increase in the amount of time

                            well-represented on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
                            LinkedIn and other social media sites is vital these
                            days. Social media marketing facilitates brand

                            inorganically. Social media marketing helps a brand
                            connect with its audience in a personal way that
                            increases trust. It can be smartly used to promote
                            your products and services. Increased brand
