            You acknowledge and agree that these Terms and Conditions constitute

            sole discretion, to change these Terms and Conditions at any time by
            posting the changes on the site and providing notice of such change.
            Any changes are effective immediately upon posting to the site and
            release of notice of such change. Your continued use of the site
            thereafter constitutes your agreement to all such changed Terms and
            Conditions. We may, with or without prior notice, terminate any of
            the rights granted by these Terms and Conditions. You shall comply
            immediately with any termination or other notice, including, as
            applicable, by ceasing all use of the site. Nothing contained in

            unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by
            any applicable arbitral award or court decision, such
            unenforceability or invalidity shall not render these Terms and
            Conditions unenforceable or invalid as a whole but these Terms and
            Conditions shall be modified, to the extent possible, by the
            adjudicating entity to most fully reflect the original intent of the
            parties as reflected in the original provision.
